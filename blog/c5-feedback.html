      <h1>Phase 0 Week 5</h1>
      <h3>Sharing is caring</h3>
      <p>7 December 2014</p>
      <p>This week we're talking about feedback.I think it'll be easier to do this one Q&A style so Ill break it down below and try to answer the questions as best I can.<br><br>

      <strong>Pairing:</strong><br><br>

      Q: What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?<br>
      A: Pairing at the moment can be a bit difficult for me, I'm typically more at ease doing things in person, and also find it easier to communicate face to face. In saying that, everyone I've paired with so far has been great, they've all been really easy to get along with and it's nice to know that alot of us are in the same boat skills wise. Often I'll spend longer on a pairing challenge than on an individual challenge but the answers then to come out quite a bit fuller, which I think is the result of discussion.<br><br>

      Q: Was something particularly fun or rewarding?<br>
      A: My favourite part of any challenge is the moment when you crack a particurly difficult code block and the pieces start clicking together. I found that when I'm working on a challenge with someone else and we get one of those moments it's even better. This is probably because of the increase sense of accomplishment having solved it as a team, and I think that only serves to strengthen partnerships within the cohort for me.<br><br>

      Q: Was something frustrating and difficult for you?<br>
      A: This isn't exclusive to pairing challenges but I find it frustrating when I come to the end of my knowledge. Knowing where to look next is always a bit of a challenge especially after already having researched a topic. I think that this is probably made easier though, by having someone to talk to about the challenge.<br><br>


      <strong>Feedback</strong><br><br>

      Q: How did you feel when you read your feedback?<br>
      A: At this stage I've not been able to read any of my feedback! Apparently its still waiting for review but hopefully its good and critical when I do get it. I personally preffer for people to tell me what I could do better upfront so that I can prep for next time right away.<br><br>

      Q: Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?<br>
      A: N/A<br><br>

      Q: Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?<br>
      A: So far I've only gotten verbal feedback at the end of sessions, but I think looking back on things I should continue to start the sessions with a personal catch up before we start coding. In this weeks one that was really helpful and made it alot easier to establish roles during the challenge.<br><br>

      Q: How was it to write feedback?<br>
      A: As a designer I'm very much of two minds on feedback and writing it. I myself value critical feedback on how I can improve over anything else, and have been trained to take it for what it is (instead of getting defensive about it). I realize that others aren't nessecarily quite so accustomed to it though so I'm trying to keep it positive without sugar coating it too much. All in all its a little bit difficult but hopefully everyone takes it for the improvements.<br><br>

      Q: What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?<br>
      A: Writing the critical parts is always to most difficult. Mostly because the wording of things can either make or break it. It usually takes me a short while to figure out how to suggest to someone ways they can improve themselves without sounding like I'm telling them how (difference between suggest and tell).<br><br>

      Q: Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?<br>
      A: I think it's got great benefits. It's not second nature to me (remotely at least) but I'm finding that its easier with every session! Feedback is something that I value greatly so I really enjoy getting it, hopefully my EDA feedback comes through shortly!<br><br>
