      <h1>Phase 0 Week 1</h1>
      <h3>Cultural Blog - EDA Experience</h3>
      <p>9th November 2014</p>
      <p>Starting phase zero has been a bit of a whirlwind. All of the new information has been borderline overwhelming, but I can already tell that I'm going to get exactly what I'be been expecting out of the course in it's entirety.<br><br>

      Last week I had no Idea how to do anything in the terminal or what Git or Github were, and now I'm commiting and pushing files with ease.<br><br>

      After watching the video of Shereef's Fireside Chat, my impressions of EDA haven't really changed at all.
      I've always thought that this would be about learning to learn, rather than learning to code. Sure as a by product I'll come out of it with skills in Ruby, Javascript etc. But really the time spent on this is about a set of techniques and challenging what we've been traditionally taught to accept as a learning outcome.<br><br>

      Empathy appears to be a big point, working with nice people, being nice to people, understanding how to build great things for other nice people. It's something I'm really excited about as my goals with this are to have the core skills sit along side my design background, which also utilises empathy as a key method of achieving excellence.<br><br>

      All in all I'm still almost overwhelmed by the different emotions circling in my head right now, and I dont expect that to stop during my time at EDA. But it's a good thing, I'm unsure of my own knowledge base, but excited to get stuck into learning new things and engaging with new people. I'm sure with empathy as a core tenet of the EDA experience we're all sure to help each other along the way to a new and exciting future.<br><br>

      <h1>Phase 0 Week 1</h1>
      <h3>On Version control, git tracking, and Github</h3>
      <p>9 November 2014</p>
      <p>This week for challenge ten of EDA we're writing about Version Control, Git tracking and Github.<br><br>

      I myself have only been learning about this for a short while now so feel free to let me know if theres anything im getting wrong.<br><br>


      Everyones had this problem at one point in their lives. Whether you're writing an essay for school, a report for work, or creating a file in Illustrator, we've all overwritten our main file only to find out six overwrites down the track that we deleted a paragraph that's now necessary, or converted some text to paths that now needs changing.<br><br>

      Its a major hassle.<br><br>

      Version control helps to avoid this hassle by saving an individual copy of your file every time you change it. If you make a mistake on version twelve and need to go back to version ten, then you can.<br><br>

      Now lets apply this to a development context.<br><br>

      In development we have a Version Control system called Git.<br>
      Git allows us to view previous changes we've made to our files by viewing a log of those changes. On top of that we can also create separate versions of our files called "Branches" where we can try weird and wacky things. If the experementing doesnt work then we can simply delete a branch and the original files will still be there. This is great for individuals but where it really starts to shine is on collaborative projects.<br><br>

      Enter Github<br><br>

      We use Github as a sort of dropbox for coding collaboration. By sharing folders or "Repositories" with other developers we are able to all work on parts of a project at the same time. When I've finished my part I'll save or "commit" a version on my computer, and then push that up to the shared folder or "remote-repository". When all these systems work together great things begin to happen. Git makes sure that you dont overwrite each others files, but can instead merge them all togther. I can be working on part 1 and you can be working on part 2, and instead of my part 1 overwriting your part 2, it will merge them together in the repository.<br><br>

      All of this makes Git and Github ideal for developers, making collaborative development much easier.<br><br>

      Thats it for the first post Ill be back next week with something else new and exciting!<br><br>
