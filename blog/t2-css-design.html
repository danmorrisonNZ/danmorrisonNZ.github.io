      <h1>Phase 0 Week 2</h1>
      <h3>CSS Positioning</h3>
      <p>22 November 2014</p>
      <p>A bit of a late one this week but here we go! This weeks Technical Blog is on CSS Positioning and the difference between the Absolute, Relative and Fixed states.
      <br><br>
      Before we jump into the specifics lets preface the whole topic with a bit of analogue context. Imagine each browser window as a white piece of magical paper.A landscape rectangle with the ability to change size at will. Now imagine an element in that browser window, say, an image, or a block of text, as a coloured square of paper on top of your white piece of paper. This is how elements in a website work, they can be placed on top of each other, next to each other and can be placed off the page all together if you want them to be. <br>
      Now instead of moving them with our hands we need to move them with code, and thats where CSS positioning comes in.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Fixed Positioning</strong>
      Fixed positioning is relative to your browsers window.
      This means that a fixed element will always stay in its position no matter where your browser window goes.
      In the following 3 images you can see how my left hand navigation and right hand about section are both fixed and will stay in their positions no matter if I scroll down on the page, or if I re-size the window.
      <img src="Imgs/Fixed1.png" />
      <img src="Imgs/Fixed2.png" />
      <img src="Imgs/Fixed3.png" />
      In fact you can even try it on this window, go ahead and try resizing the window to see how the fixed elements behave in real time.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Relative Positioning</strong>
      Relative positioning is relative to itself. That might sound confusing but really all you need to think of it as, is fixed positioning with a bit more wiggle room. Where as fixed position is positioned relative to the browser window, relative postioning is relative to where ever it thinks it is. In practice this means you can position a relative element, then scroll down the page, and the relative element will magically dissapear into the top of the window. You can try that right now as well, click on the archive button on the left hand side and try scrolling down to see what happens.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Absolute Positioning</strong>
      Abosolute Positioning takes the law into its own hands. Where Fixed and Relative positioning go with the flow of the page and play nicely together, Absolute positioning plays by its own rules. An aboslute element doesn't care if your fixed or relative elements are pushing everything over to the right, it'll stay right where it is. Think of it as gluing one of those pieces of paper from earlier to your original page. Absolute elements can be placed anywhere and are relative to their parent elements (meaning the next element up that isn't static) or if there is no parent element then to the HTML tags.
      <br><br>
      I've run out of time for this weeks post though so hopefully thats explained well enough for now!
      <br><br>
      Until next time
