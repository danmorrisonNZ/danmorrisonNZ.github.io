        <h1>Phase 0 Week 4</h1>
      <h3>Tech Issues and Net Neutrality</h3>
      <p>30th November 2014</p>
      <p>This weeks cultural blog is on Tech Issues and more specifically on Net Neutrality.<br><br>
        Whether we're consumers of content on the internet, or creators of it, net Neutrality affects us all. The underpinning concept of it, is that the internet should be open for access and when you have a connection, your speeds when traveling to different sites should only be affected by their construction. <br>
        However some think that in an increasingly competitive consumer culture ISPs (or Internet Service Providers), might start running a "pay to play" system for web navigation speeds.<br>
        In short this means that companies with alot of money could pay to have their websites put in an "internet fast lane" of sorts, while those on a budget (see:most new business) would have speeds throttled. At best your connection to Sparks Lightbox service could speed right up and at worst, your sisters cake making business could get zero traffic due to ridiculous load times.<br><br>
        In a culture where transparency is increasingly demanded from any and all companies, both big and small, Net Neutrality is the very embodiement of old world corporate greed. <br><br>
        ISP's around the world are denying that there are any plans to introduce internet fast lanes or pay to play systems, but the only true way to prevent it is through binding legalities.<br>
        To keep the internet truely open, governments around the world would need to create laws that prevent ISPs from creating fast lanes and throttling speeds at users expense and to make that happen the world of consumers and creators alike need to come together and be heard.<br><br>
