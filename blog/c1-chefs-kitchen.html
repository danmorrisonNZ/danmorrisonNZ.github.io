      <h1>Phase 0 Week 1</h1>
      <h3>Cultural Blog - EDA Experience</h3>
      <p>9th November 2014</p>
      <p>Starting phase zero has been a bit of a whirlwind. All of the new information has been borderline overwhelming, but I can already tell that I'm going to get exactly what I'be been expecting out of the course in it's entirety.<br><br>

      Last week I had no Idea how to do anything in the terminal or what Git or Github were, and now I'm commiting and pushing files with ease.<br><br>

      After watching the video of Shereef's Fireside Chat, my impressions of EDA haven't really changed at all.
      I've always thought that this would be about learning to learn, rather than learning to code. Sure as a by product I'll come out of it with skills in Ruby, Javascript etc. But really the time spent on this is about a set of techniques and challenging what we've been traditionally taught to accept as a learning outcome.<br><br>

      Empathy appears to be a big point, working with nice people, being nice to people, understanding how to build great things for other nice people. It's something I'm really excited about as my goals with this are to have the core skills sit along side my design background, which also utilises empathy as a key method of achieving excellence.<br><br>

      All in all I'm still almost overwhelmed by the different emotions circling in my head right now, and I dont expect that to stop during my time at EDA. But it's a good thing, I'm unsure of my own knowledge base, but excited to get stuck into learning new things and engaging with new people. I'm sure with empathy as a core tenet of the EDA experience we're all sure to help each other along the way to a new and exciting future.<br><br>
