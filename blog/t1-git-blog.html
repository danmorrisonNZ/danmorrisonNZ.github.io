      <h1>Phase 0 Week 1</h1>
      <h3>On Version control, git tracking, and Github</h3>
      <p>9 November 2014</p>
      <p>This week for challenge ten of EDA we're writing about Version Control, Git tracking and Github.<br><br>

      I myself have only been learning about this for a short while now so feel free to let me know if theres anything im getting wrong.<br><br>


      Everyones had this problem at one point in their lives. Whether you're writing an essay for school, a report for work, or creating a file in Illustrator, we've all overwritten our main file only to find out six overwrites down the track that we deleted a paragraph that's now necessary, or converted some text to paths that now needs changing.<br><br>

      Its a major hassle.<br><br>

      Version control helps to avoid this hassle by saving an individual copy of your file every time you change it. If you make a mistake on version twelve and need to go back to version ten, then you can.<br><br>

      Now lets apply this to a development context.<br><br>

      In development we have a Version Control system called Git.<br>
      Git allows us to view previous changes we've made to our files by viewing a log of those changes. On top of that we can also create separate versions of our files called "Branches" where we can try weird and wacky things. If the experementing doesnt work then we can simply delete a branch and the original files will still be there. This is great for individuals but where it really starts to shine is on collaborative projects.<br><br>

      Enter Github<br><br>

      We use Github as a sort of dropbox for coding collaboration. By sharing folders or "Repositories" with other developers we are able to all work on parts of a project at the same time. When I've finished my part I'll save or "commit" a version on my computer, and then push that up to the shared folder or "remote-repository". When all these systems work together great things begin to happen. Git makes sure that you dont overwrite each others files, but can instead merge them all togther. I can be working on part 1 and you can be working on part 2, and instead of my part 1 overwriting your part 2, it will merge them together in the repository.<br><br>

      All of this makes Git and Github ideal for developers, making collaborative development much easier.<br><br>

      Thats it for the first post Ill be back next week with something else new and exciting!<br><br>
