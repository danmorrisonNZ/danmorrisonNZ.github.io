      <h1>Phase 0 Week 3</h1>
      <h3>Thinking Style</h3>
      <p>23rd November 2014</p>
      <p>This Weeks Cultural blog is on Thinking Styles.<br><br>
      It was interesting to find that my particular thinking style is that of a Concrete Random thinker, mostly because it seems to fit in pretty well with my Briggs-Myers result of ENTJ. I'm open to experimenting and taking risks but fall short in repeating tasks, probably largely due to the "do it once, do it right" attitude. <br><br>
      I always find these types of self reflexive tests interesting though, as it provides insight into personal shortcomings so that I might be able to address them in the future; or at least become a bit more self aware.
      <br><br>
      I think the two things I'll need to address going forward are the aversion to repeating tasks and the frustration with having to choose a single answer. As Ive learnt in Dev Academy so far, theres not always time to be a perfectionist which I think these particular traits only amplify. <br>Strategy wise, I really need to let certain things go, and be ok with leaving a task in a less than ideal state (in my opinion at least). If I can meet the learning outcomes and come back to them later for further study, then my time management should improve greatly.
