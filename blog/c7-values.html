      <h1>Phase 0 Week 7</h1>
      <h3>Values</h3>
      <p>23rd December 2014</p>
      <p>This weeks cultural blog follows on from last weeks blog on stereotype threat. Today I'll be discussing my personal values and why they're important to me.<br><br>
      Values that are important to me include but are not limited to:<strong> Accomplishment, Adventure, Achievement, Ambition, Challenge, Community, Compassion, Confidence, Control, Courage, Creativity, Integrity, Justice, Meaningful Work, Quality, Recognition, and Truth.</strong> <br><br>
      On a Scale from one to five on how much I try to live up to these values:<br>
      Accomplishment <strong>4</strong><br>
      Adventure <strong>2</strong><br>
      Achievement <strong>4</strong><br>
      Ambition <strong>5</strong><br>
      Challenge <strong>4</strong><br>
      Community <strong>3</strong><br>
      Compassion <strong>5</strong><br>
      Confidence <strong>3</strong><br>
      Control <strong>4</strong><br>
      Courage <strong>3</strong><br>
      Creativity <strong>5</strong><br>
      Integrity <strong>5</strong><br>
      Justice <strong>5</strong><br>
      Meaningful Work <strong>4</strong><br>
      Quality <strong>4</strong><br>
      Recognition <strong>2</strong><br>
      Truth <strong>4</strong><br><br>
      In particular Truth and Integrity are important to me, as well as Justice, and I believe that all three go hand in hand. I've always been a particularly just person and have never liked the thought of dishonest people getting away with things. I believe that if we are all truthful and maintain a solid sense of justice then the world can be a fairer place for everyone. This tends to blend well with my sense of compassion and i'll often give people benefit of the doubt or a second chance (as opposing as that may seem to the justice side of things).<br><br>
      <strong>Advice</strong> - The last topic I asked someone for advice on was ambition and accomplishment. I had discussed ambitions and what accomplishment is with my parents and it was nice to get some advice and a good grounding on what both can really mean in a lifetime.<br><br>
      <strong>Values and StereoType Threat</strong> - I feel like my particular values all combine well to combat stereotype threat, I'm compassionate enough witha good enough sense of community to think about things twice instead of just taking the "common" opinion and my sense of Justice will likely never allow me to effectively participate in puporting stereotypes and should infact help me to reassure those who are facing stereotype threat.
