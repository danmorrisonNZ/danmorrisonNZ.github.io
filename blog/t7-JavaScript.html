      <h1>Phase 0 Week 7</h1>
      <h3>JavaScript vs Ruby</h3>
      <p>23rd December 2014</p>
      <p>This weeks technical blog is on differences between JavaScript and Ruby, namely the differences between hashes and objects.<br><br>
      Starting off with the smaller details JavaScript objects are referenced as property and value pairs while ruby hashes are key and value pairs, this ends up making more sense down the line and I'll explain it as part of a bigger difference between the two soon. Javascript objects are accessed with objectname.propertyname and added to with objectname.propertyname = value, where as hashes are accessed with hashname[:propertyname] and added to with hashname[:newproperty] = value. Now comes the one of the bigger differences, while both a ways of organising data structures; in JavaScript, almost everything is an object, where as in Ruby Hashes are created specifically as "dictionaries". This means that the property and value pairs I talked about earlier now make a lot more sense when you think of every object (even pre defined ones) having properties and values that can be accessed (within thier relative scope). Hashes on the other hand can still be accessed but dont serve to make up as much of Ruby, as Ruby is also made up primarily of its own objects and classes.<br><br>
      Unfortunately thats where my understanding ends at this stage, so this will have to be a short post today, hopefully a little further down the line I'll be able to do a second update once I've had a bit more time using both!
