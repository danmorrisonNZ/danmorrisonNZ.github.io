      <h1>Phase 0 Week 6</h1>
      <h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
      <p>15 December 2014</p>
      <p> This weeks cultural blog is on Stereotype Threat. Stereotype Threat in a nutshell is when your performance in any given task is affected negatively by a cultural stereotype.<br><br>
       You might think that being a young white male I'd have avoided this during my lifetime as I'm in what is likely to be seen by many as a highly privileged group, but like most people even I have expereinced the negative implications of Stereotype threat. During my childhood years I achieved quite well academically but that achievement took a slight dive during highschool when I began to realise that my passions were with creative subjects. While I still took academic classes I identified myself with a creative stereotype, namely that creatives were no good in academia. Of course when I came to university to study design my eyes were opened to the creative and academic combinations that design thinking yeilded, but still my engagement with subjects such as math and english during the highschool years dropped(not largely but enough to cause my achievement to fall a level), largely due to the pattern of thought that you could not be both an academic and a creative.<br><br>
       While this example and its consequences may not be as extreme as some others the process of realisation that creatives could also be academics was an enlightening one and ultimately taught me to look upon simmilar situations in a different light.<br><br>
       The culture that we need to foster in any environment, be it a workplace or a institute of learing, is one of encouragement and acceptance. Everyone has faults but I believe that we are all also capable of achieving much more than stereotypes would suggest. As such, if I see someone struggling I usually do my best to find out why, and help them to work through ways that they can achieve their goal, doing my best to avoid mentioning any cultural, racial or gender stereotypes. The more we can provide others with that moment of realisation that stereotypes are infact wrong (such as the one I had at university), the better we can help each other to perform, and in-turn the greater we can achieve at a societal level.<br><br>
       Thats the bulk of it for this week anyway but thanks again for reading!<br><br>
