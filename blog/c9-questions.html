       <h1>Phase 0 Week 9</h1>
      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <p>15th January 2015</p>
      <p> It's the last week before the full emersion phase starts! This week we're looking at questions, what makes a good one and what makes a bad one. I'll start off by providing a quick run down of what makes a good question, followed by a break down of a badly asked question and finally a rework to make that into a good question.<br><br>
        <strong><h1> So what makes a good question?</h1></strong><br><br>
        <strong>1. The Elevator Pitch</strong><br>
        You may very well have heard of the concept of an elevator pitch, to clarify the elevator pitch is a method of thinking which is commonly used by entrepreneurs with young businesses to pitch for venture capital. For the rest of us, it's a great exercise to really hone in on the key points and most important parts of an idea, job description or for the purposes of this post, <strong>a question.</strong><br> The main purpose of an elevator pitch is to disitll your question to its most understandable but also most interesting point. The idea is that if you know exactly what you need to ask and where your problem is occuring, then you can more quickly begin a discussion on how to solve that problem.An elevator pitch style question can make for a good title before getting into the detail in paragraphs if posting online, and can save you alot of confusion and mumbling if asking in person.<br><br>
        <strong>2. Provide a broken example</strong><br>
        Once you've distilled your question into an easily understandable pitch, you'll need to provide an example of what you're talking about. This can help speed things along even further, as others may pick up on parts of code you've not even noticed yourself. Again its about being specific, theres no point in providing your enitre programme if you're only asking about a single block.<br><br>
        <strong>3. Read it twice</strong><br>
        Correct spelling and grammar to the best of your own abilities are as essential as a good question itself. As much as it sounds like your old english teacher speaking, make sure to proof read your question before posting. It can save you having to explain yourself again and makes all of the thinking you did on your elevator pitch worth it.<br><br>
        <strong>4. Include relevant tags</strong><br>
        If you're posting online make sure to include site appropriate tags. They can be the difference between someone with the knowledge to answer your question finding it or not.<br><br>
        <strong>5. Keep the discussion going!</strong><br>
        Remember to provide feedback to the answers provided to your question. If someone provides a solution but didn't quite understand the context correctly, let them know and try to help them understand how their solution differs from what you were looking for. In the spirit of kindness if someone helps you out with an answer that is exactly what you were looking for, thanks them!<br><br>
        <strong><h1> A not so good question </h1></strong><br><br>
        Here is an example of a question I asked a while ago, complete with code snippet:<br>
        "Hey guys having a bit of trouble with a challenge and wondering if anyone can help. Ive managed to put together the parts of this guessing game to return correct, high or low, but can't figure out what I need to write to change solved between true and false based on those returns"<br>
        <img src = "Imgs/code-snippet.png"/><br>
        Here I've provided a code snippet in the correct format, but have already fallen at the first hurdle by not being specific enough with my question (elevator) pitch.<br><br>
        <strong><h1> A better question </h1></strong><br><br>
        A better way to ask this question would have been:<br>
        "Hey guys,in ruby, how can I get my solved function to change to true or false based on the return value of my guess function?"<br>
        This is a lot better and when paired with the above image, gives more specific context as to what im asking about. By no means is this question the golden standard but it has considerably more thought put into it and could be the difference between a good answer or no answer at all.<br><br>
        Thats it for this week, but wish me luck for the begining of full emersion when we start Phase 1 next week!<br><br>
