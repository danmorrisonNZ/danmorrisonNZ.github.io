      <h1>Phase 0 Week 3</h1>
      <h3>On Arrays and Hashes</h3>
      <p>23rd November 2014</p>
      <p>This weeks technical blog is on the difference between Arrays and Hashes.
      <br><br>
      Before we get into the details lets look at the bigger picture. Arrays and Hashes are both ways of creating librarys of data. That is to say you can store different values within them. Say you really like cats; infact you like them so much that you have twenty of them. But your memory is also starting to fade and you need a way to keep track of all their names. You can create an Array or Hash to store all these names and call on them later depending on your preffered way of referencing.
      <br><br>
      This is where the major difference between the two comes in. While both store librarys of data, each piece of data in an Array is referenced with a number with the first number being 0, the second being 1, the third being 2 and so on and so forth. Hashs on the other hand are structured slightly differently; each piece of data in a hash is referenced with a key rather than a number. The key can be anything a name, a number, what ever you like, but you decide what it is.
      So while an Array will operate like this:
      <br><br>
      ['molly', 'ringo', 'butch', 'sunny', 'gutenburg'] <br>
      With molly being number 0, ringo being number 1, butch being number 2, etc.<br><br>
      A hash will operate more like this:<br><br>
      ['blackspot' => 'molly', 'glasses' => 'ringo', 'fatty' => 'butch', 'smiles' => 'sunny', 'paperman' => 'gutenburg']<br>
      With Mollys reference being 'blackspot', ringos reference being 'glasses' etc.<br><br>
      Both have their advantages namely being that Arrays are more useful for high effeciency tasks given their ability to be ordered and retrieved via numbers, and Hashs are more flexable, allowing for a greater level of specifity and reference if thats crucial to the task.
