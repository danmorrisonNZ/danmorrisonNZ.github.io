       <h1>Phase 0 Week 8</h1>
      <h3>Conflict</h3>
      <p>10th January 2015</p>
      <p>This weeks cultural blog is on conflict and will be written as another Q&A style post.<br><br>

        <strong>Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?</strong><br>
        The conlfict I've chosen to discuss is centered around my choice to come to Dev Academy. After experiencing the highs and lows of university life my first job was initially rewarding before ulitmately becoming boring and unfulfilling. While looking for other options I was told about Dev Academy by a friend, which then set of a whole trail of doubt.<br><br>

        <strong>What was the source of the conflict?</strong><br>
        The source of the confilct ended up being doubt, both doubt about my own skill set as well as doubt about whether it was really the direction I wanted to head in career wise. This in-turn could be boiled further down to a lack of self confidence and self assertion.<br><br>

        <strong>What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</strong><br>
        The basic emotions I felt were fairly varied including, confusion, sadness, disapointment, but then also leading into happiness, and excitement as I worked through it.<br><br>

        <strong>What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?</strong><br>
        I did alot of thinking and research into the industry, including contacting people in it, the languages that were taught, the course itself and also my own career path and where I wanted to be later in life. It helped me to realise that it was well worth giving it a go, as tech was already a big passion of mine and there were a a lot more unexplored opportunities within the industry compared to my current graphic focused industry.<br><br>

        <strong>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</strong><br>
        I think next time I would back myself from the get go a bit more. Initially my thoughts were that I wasn't intelligent enough to embark into something like computer science but after thinking about my history I realised that I should be able to apply myself to the subject. In terms of the research that I did, I would try to condense it down to a shorter time scale as if I had, I may have been able to get into an earlier cohort.<br><br>

        <strong>What did you learn from this experience?</strong><br>
        To back myself! One of the main sources of the conflict was self doubt and I've found that when I'm confident about myself and my abilities I can achieve much greater things. Thinking back on any time of great success throughout my life they've all be when I've been confident in my own abilities so a little bit less self doubt can go a long way!<br><br>
